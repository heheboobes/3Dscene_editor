# AGENTS.md — Scene Editor

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

A single-window 3D scene authoring tool: heightfield terrain sculpting and
texture painting, glTF/VRM prop placement, instanced vegetation painting,
snap-based block building, HDR skybox import, and .scene save/load.
C++20, OpenGL 3.3 core, Dear ImGui, GLFW, GLM 1.0.3, cgltf, stb. Unit tests
(doctest, `tests/`); integration verification is by building and running.

## Build & run

```bash
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
# binary: build/bin/scene_editor.exe (shaders/ are copied next to it)
```

- The app loads shaders from `<cwd>/shaders` — run it from `build/bin`.
- Dependencies are FetchContent'd (GLFW 3.4, GLM 1.0.3,
  ImGui v1.92.5-**docking**, cgltf v1.15, stb — pinned commit,
  nlohmann_json v3.11.3, doctest v2.4.11). Docking + multi-viewport are NOT
  in mainline ImGui 1.9x — the `vX.Y.Z-docking` branch tag is required
  (`ImGuiConfigFlags_DockingEnable` doesn't exist in plain v1.92.x).
  GLAD2 is vendored in `external/glad/`. doctest's legacy
  `cmake_minimum_required(3.0)` needs the `CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM`
  escape hatch in CMakeLists (expect one harmless upstream warning).
- CLI smoke test: `scene_editor model.glb sky.hdr test.savetest`
  (.savetest = save the scene then immediately reload it). Debug flag:
  `--mateditor` opens the material windows and selects the first material.
- Unit tests: `cmake --build build --target tests && build/bin/tests.exe`.

**App is a single class split across four translation units**
(`editor/app.cpp`, `editor/app_ui.cpp`, `editor/app_panels.cpp`, plus
`scene/scene.cpp` for serialization). New editor features usually mean:
a subsystem class in `scene/` + a `draw*Content()` panel in `editor/` +
wiring in `App::handleInput` / `renderScene`.

**UI shell (ImGui docking branch)**: the scene renders into `viewportFbo_`
(sized to the "Viewport" window's content rect); `renderImGui()` draws a
full-window `DockSpaceOverViewport` + docked windows — Viewport (FBO image),
Toolbar (tool/panel/brush icon strip), Tools (active tool's `draw*Content()`),
Hierarchy (props/blocks/layers with selection), Inspector
(`drawInspectorContent` = selection properties), plus toggleable Terrain /
Layers / Skybox·Settings / History / File windows. The default layout is
built once via `buildDefaultLayout()` (DockBuilder lives in
`imgui_internal.h`); afterwards the layout persists through `imgui.ini`
(default `io.IniFilename`). Multi-viewport is enabled: torn-out windows get
their own OS window via `ImGui::UpdatePlatformWindows()` +
`RenderPlatformWindowsDefault()` at the end of `renderImGui()`.

**Tools**: `App::handleInput` dispatches to `activeTool_` (an `ITool*`
pointing at one of the four tool structs in `tools.h`). Each tool owns its
drag state (e.g. `BuildTool::buildDragging_`); `cancelDrag()` must leave no
in-progress interaction behind. Sub-gizmo drag state (`Gizmo`,
`VertexEditor`) lives on App and is cancelled explicitly on tool switch —
tools only see App while active, so they can't self-cancel after a switch.

**Include resolution**: CMake adds `src/editor`, `src/scene`, and
`src/platform` to the include path, so all headers are included by short
name (`#include "model.h"`) regardless of which subdirectory the includer
lives in.

### Data flow per frame

1. `Input::newFrame()` → `glfwPollEvents()` (callbacks accumulate deltas).
2. `App::handleInput(dt)` — hotkeys, camera, then `activeTool_->handleInput`.
3. `renderScene()` — into the viewport FBO (`viewportFbo_`, sized by the
   Viewport window on the previous frame): `renderWorld()` (**shadow depth
   pass**, skipped when `showShadows_` off → main pass: skybox → terrain →
   props → details → blocks) → editor-only overlays: ghost/drag previews →
   selection boxes → gizmos → brush cursor → camera frustums.
   `updateCameraPreviews()` then renders at most ONE scene-camera thumbnail
   (256x144 FBO, round-robin) — never all cameras in a single frame;
   previews call `renderWorld` with shadows off.
4. `renderImGui()` — dockspace + docked windows (incl. the Viewport image)
   into the default framebuffer, then platform windows (multi-viewport).

### Conventions that matter (violations caused real bugs)

- **GL default state**: `GL_CULL_FACE` is OFF app-wide (the skybox cube is
  drawn from inside), `GL_DEPTH_TEST` ON. Any renderer that enables culling
  or blending for a draw MUST restore the default afterwards (see
  `Model::render` / `DetailSystem::render` tail).
- **Shaders**: no uniform initializers (GLSL 330). Every uniform must be set
  explicitly by the caller each frame — `line.frag`'s `uAlpha` is the
  canonical example. Weather uniforms (`uFogColor`/`uFogDensity`/
  `uLightScale`/`uSnowCover`/`uWindSway`/`uWindDir`/`uTime`) are set per
  subsystem in `renderWorld` from `weather_.params`; `uWindSway` is 0 for
  props/characters and must be re-asserted in the shadow depth pass too
  (uniforms persist per program). Vegetation sway lives in `prop.vert`
  (instanced path only).
- **HiDPI + viewport window**: mouse coords from `Input` are in *window*
  pixels relative to the main window; the scene viewport is the Viewport
  window's FBO in *framebuffer* pixels. Use `App::cursorRay()`; sub-gizmos
  get the rect via `setViewportRect()` once per frame (`App::handleInput`).
  The mapping (image pos + scale) is captured in `drawViewportWindow()`.
- **Input gating with docking**: `io.WantCaptureMouse` is true over EVERY
  docked window (including the Viewport) — never gate tool input on it
  directly. The authoritative flag is App's `overUI = WantCaptureMouse &&
  !viewportHovered_`; scene-layer classes (Gizmo, VertexEditor) receive it
  as a parameter. Scene picking is disabled while the Viewport window is
  torn out into its own OS window (mouse coords don't map).
- **ImGui version pitfalls**: DockBuilder* (`buildDefaultLayout`) lives in
  `imgui_internal.h`, not `imgui.h`. 1.92 changed `ImTextureID` to `ImU64`
  and reworked `ImFontAtlas` (no custom fonts here — icons are ImDrawList
  vectors — so the font rework is a no-op for us). 1.92 also highlights
  duplicate IDs with a big red banner — never use display labels as
  PushID strings (a tool and a brush type can share a name).
- **Torn-out windows**: a floating ImGui window that crosses the main
  viewport edge is automatically moved into its own OS window — initial
  placements must provably fit (auto-sized windows grow from 0, so anchor
  by centre). A torn-out OS window owns the keyboard focus while active:
  all app hotkeys (GLFW callbacks on the main window) go dead.
- **Hotkeys**: global shortcuts must be gated on `!ImGui::GetIO().WantTextInput`
  (see `App::handleInput`), or they fire while typing into text fields.
- **Scene cameras**: `CameraRig` ids are the game's stable key — never reuse
  one (`addCameraWithId` for undo/load). The active id is the game's initial
  camera. Editor jump-to-pose inverts the orbit parameterisation
  (`App::activateSceneCamera`); cycling hotkeys are `[`/`]`. The camera tool
  is a pure cursor tool (no brush): left-click picks a camera via
  `App::pickSceneCamera` (ray vs position/target/frustum corners, nearest
  wins), empty click deselects. The frustum visualisation geometry
  (`cameraFrustumCorners`, fixed 6m depth, 16:9) is shared by drawing and
  picking — keep them in sync.
- **Spawn logic graph**: each `SpawnPoint` owns Root → Condition (true/false
  pins) → Action (chained) nodes (`spawn.h`); the game evaluates them. Undo
  for graph edits is snapshot-based (`SpawnGraphCommand`; structural ops
  never merge, param widgets do). The node editor is a hand-rolled ImDrawList
  canvas in `app_panels.cpp` (`nodeEdCanvas`/`nodeEdParamsPanel`) — cycle
  check before linking via `spawnGraphReachable`; node ids follow the same
  never-reuse rule as other subsystems. `LogicNode::Kind` constants are
  `Cond`/`Act` (un-suffixed names would shadow the `Condition`/`Action`
  structs inside the struct scope).
- **Material graphs**: CPU-baked procedural textures, NOT shader codegen —
  `bakeMaterial` evaluates the DAG per pixel (vec4 per node, scalars as
  grey; Image nodes use stb, noise uses `platform/noise.h` with per-seed
  perm tables). The workflow is Bake → Export PNG → assign the PNG to
  terrain layers / block textures (the game consumes plain textures);
  graphs persist in the scene for editing. `in[]` links point at sources,
  so the cycle rule is `matGraphReachable(g, source, target)` — the
  opposite direction from spawn graphs. The node canvas in app_panels.cpp
  (`matEdCanvas`/`matEdParamsPanel`) mirrors the Spawn Logic one with
  multi-input pins. PNG export goes through stb_image_write +
  `writeFileBytes` (UTF-8 paths). The 3D sphere preview is a SEPARATE
  window ("Material Preview", own FBO + `matpreview` shader, drag-to-orbit,
  256px bake); the debounced rebake lives in the run loop — never gate it
  on a panel being open (that was the "black sphere" bug). CLI debug flag:
  `--mateditor` opens the three material windows + selects the first
  material.
- **Simulation**: `SimController` (GL-free, unit-tested) continuously
  re-resolves each graph from the root; a changed resolution restarts that
  action chain. RandomChance latches per session (re-roll = restart);
  PlayerNear measures XZ distance to the camera target (the "player"
  proxy). CameraFocus emits requests consumed in `App::updateSimulation`
  (orbit-pose lerp). Marker models render in bind pose via
  `App::spawnModels_` (lazy per-marker load keyed by spawn id, synced every
  frame in `renderScene`): editing shows all of them, a running simulation
  shows only spawned markers (Spawn/Despawn toggle visibility live). Model
  +Z = marker facing (yaw); feet rest on the marker point. No animation
  playback yet — the sim's current animation shows as a floating label.
- **Drag state**: captured at mouse-press (e.g. `buildDragErase_`), never
  re-read modifiers at release. Tool switches (Tab/category click) must
  cancel in-progress drags (`Gizmo::cancelDrag`, `VertexEditor::cancelDrag`,
  `buildDragging_ = false`).
- **Vector-pointer invalidation**: `PropManager`/`BuildSystem` store elements
  in `std::vector` and hand out raw pointers (`findProp`, `selected()`).
  Never keep such a pointer across a call that may `push_back` (e.g.
  `addProp`) — copy the values first.
- **Resource lifetime**: all GL objects are released in `App::shutdown()`
  while the context is current, *before* `glfwTerminate()`. Classes with GL
  resources implement `create()`/`destroy()`; destructors call `destroy()`
  defensively but must find zeroed handles by then. `Shader::~Shader` relies
  on this — do not reorder.
- **File paths**: all file IO accepts UTF-8 and goes through
  `sys_util::readFileBytes`/`writeFileBytes` or `stbi_load_from_memory`;
  cgltf uses custom file callbacks (`model.cpp`). Never use plain
  `fopen`/`ifstream`/`stbi_load` for user-supplied paths (ANSI on Windows).
- **Scene loading**: every length/index field from a `.scene` file is
  validated against the buffer before use (see the `readU32`/`readBlob`
  cursors in `scene_io.cpp::loadScene`). Keep it that way.
- **Shadow map**: lives on texture unit 7 (`App::kShadowTexUnit`) — terrain
  owns units 0-5, prop materials 0-4, block texture 0. The depth FBO texture
  uses `GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE` (required by `sampler2DShadow`); it must be
  unbound from the unit before it is rendered into (feedback loop), and the
  depth pass runs with `uEnableShadow = 0`. Front-face culling during the
  depth pass must be re-asserted per subsystem — `Model::render` toggles
  `GL_CULL_FACE` internally.
- **Build & CI**: `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` on `scene_editor`; dependency
  includes are `SYSTEM` (warnings only on our code). New code must be
  warning-clean. `.clang-format` is provided (Google-based, 4-space, K&R).
- **Undo/Redo**: tools mutate the scene FIRST, then push a `Command`
  (`scene/commands.h`) with before/after data — `History::push` never calls
  `redo()`. One command per stroke/drag (capture at press, push at release).
  `Command::merge(const Command&)` coalesces same-kind edits (prop slider
  drags) — it must not take ownership of its argument. Prop/block ids are
  preserved across undo/redo via `addPropWithId`/`placeBlockWithId`; never
  capture raw `Prop*`/`Block*` pointers in commands (vector reallocation).
  `App::loadScene` clears the history. Hotkeys: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y.

### .scene format

Single binary file: `"SCNE"` magic + version + JSON metadata + heights blob
+ splat blob. The authoritative description is the comment in `src/scene/scene.h`.

## Common tasks

- **New brush type**: `Terrain::BrushParams::Type` + `applyBrush` branch +
  icon in `ui_icons.cpp` + entry in `brushTypeName` + toolbar brush section/
  hotkeys.
- **New dock window**: `show*` flag + `draw*Window()` wrapper in
  `app_ui.cpp` + `draw*Content()` in `app_panels.cpp` + toggle cell in
  `drawToolbarWindow` + `DockBuilderDockWindow` in `buildDefaultLayout`.
- **New uniform**: no registration needed; `Shader::set*` caches locations.
  Remember to set it every frame (no initializers in GLSL).
